=== '''Lokebutt Mcavre (Zyathé)''' ===

==== '''Overview''' ====
Lokebutt Mcavre is the jester and leader (''Bravda'') of the Grey Wanderers Hanataz Troupe, a traveling band of entertainers and mystics. Originally from Vanzentea in East Verdestia, Lokebutt is known for his sharp wit, dark humor, and mischievous nature. Despite his carefree persona, he has connections in high places, serving as a trusted emissary to Lord Raontal Kairoma.

==== '''Physical Description''' ====
Lokebutt possesses a striking appearance, with distinctive black and white horns curving downward from his temples. His face is painted in a black and white diamond-patterned motley, adding to his theatrical presence. His ever-present crooked smirk and flamboyant attire reinforce his reputation as a charismatic and unpredictable trickster.

==== '''Personality''' ====
Lokebutt thrives on chaos and whimsy, using his talents to unsettle, amuse, and provoke those around him.
