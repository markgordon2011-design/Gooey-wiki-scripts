=== '''Maera Ma’andi (Zyathé)''' ===

==== '''Overview''' ====
Maera Ma’andi is a well-connected and enigmatic figure in Darkenhaven society, known publicly as a wealthy entrepreneur and fashion expert. While her origins are murky, she has cultivated an air of refinement and influence, particularly within the city’s elite circles.

==== '''Physical Description''' ====
Details about Maera's appearance are scarce, but as a high-profile socialite, she is often seen impeccably dressed, blending seamlessly with the aristocracy of Highgarden. Her ability to shift between personas and settings suggests a keen eye for fashion and an adaptive presence.

==== '''Personality''' ====
Maera is highly intelligent, ambitious, and deeply strategic. She navigates social and economic circles with ease, hiding her true motives behind charm and a carefully curated public image. Her ability to maintain an aura of mystery adds to her influence, making her both respected and feared in certain circles.

==== '''Abilities or Special Qualities''' ====
Although her exact abilities remain undisclosed, Maera's skill in deception, manipulation, and business acumen is well documented. She has successfully established a reputable business, all while operating under the radar with other, less public ventures.

==== '''Background / History''' ====
Maera was reportedly born into a wealthy family in Highgarden, though no one seems to recall the exact family name. This deliberate vagueness suggests that her background may not be what it appears. She established ''Ma’andi’s Practical Parasols'', a boutique known for its stylish yet functional accessories, which she used as a stepping stone to fund less conventional enterprises.

==== '''Alliances & Relationships''' ====
Maera is the leader of the '''Haberdashery Club''', a secretive organization operating behind the façade of high fashion. The true purpose of this club is unknown, but it is suspected to involve clandestine dealings that would unsettle Darkenhaven’s more conventional elite.

Persistant rumours suggest Maera has a long-term '''friendship''' with '''Alphinius Goo''', despite the two possessing ''very'' different levels of exuberance. This has '''never''' been proven, however.

==== '''Notable Appearances or Involvement''' ====
She appears in lore related to Darkenhaven, particularly in reference to underground dealings and secret societies. Given her leadership role in the Haberdashery Club, she may play a role in intrigue-focused campaigns.
