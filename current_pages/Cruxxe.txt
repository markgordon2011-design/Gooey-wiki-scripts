=== '''Cruxxe (Zyathé)''' ===

==== '''Description''' ====
Cruxxe is a blighted, corrupted land that was once the heart of the world’s most powerful civilization. Formerly known as Resplensia, it was the seat of the Ethernic Empire and a pinnacle of High Magick before the catastrophic Woe of Ruin shattered the continent. Today, it is a desolate wasteland of unnatural horrors, its geography forever twisted by the unchecked destruction of the Zyanthuus.

==== '''Towns/Cities''' ====
No known settlements exist in Cruxxe, as the land is deemed uninhabitable. Before its fall, the continent was home to nine grand port cities, each more magnificent than modern metropolises such as Darkenhaven or Huronsana. These cities were interconnected by vast canals, magically propelled barges, and floating citadels, all of which were lost in the Woe.

==== '''Places of Interest''' ====

* '''Eternivius''' – Once the capital of the Ethernic Empire, this city was rumored to possess the ability to rise into the sky and orbit the world. It is unknown whether ruins of it still exist beneath the corrupted landscape.
* '''The Forbidden Land''' – A mysterious and horrific zone filled with abominations, eldritch magma, and twisted, living terrain. Warped priests and monstrous creatures roam these regions, engaging in unspeakable rituals.
* '''Rivers of Taint''' – Some of Cruxxe’s rivers have turned into toxic, acidic flows that dissolve anything they touch, reshaping the land into an ever-changing nightmare.

==== '''History''' ====
Cruxxe’s downfall was a direct result of the Woe of Ruin, an apocalyptic event caused by the reckless manipulation of the Zyanthuus by the Etherns. The continent was once a paradise where magic shaped everything, but its extreme reliance on High Magick made it the epicenter of destruction when the Zyanthuus collapsed. Most of its people died instantly, and the few survivors were transformed into horrific entities. The land itself became warped, making Cruxxe one of the most feared and avoided places in Zyathé.

==== '''Lore/Rumors''' ====

* Some believe that remnants of Ethernic knowledge and lost magical artifacts still lie buried beneath the ruins, though few who seek them ever return.
* Whispers speak of a hidden sect that still practices forbidden High Magick in the deepest reaches of Cruxxe, hoping to restore the lost empire.
* There are accounts of ships that pass near its coastline reporting unnatural weather patterns, disturbing visions, and even hearing the whispers of long-dead voices carried on the wind.

==== '''Appearances''' ====
Cruxxe is referenced in several historical and magical texts, particularly concerning the Woe of Ruin and the lost Ethernic civilization. It is often depicted as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked magical power.

==== '''Adventures''' ====

* '''The Lost Archives''' – An eccentric scholar hires the party to recover ancient Ethernic knowledge rumored to be hidden in a still-intact vault deep within Cruxxe.
* '''Echoes of Eternivius''' – A cryptic vision suggests that Eternivius may not be entirely lost—prompting a perilous expedition to uncover its fate.
