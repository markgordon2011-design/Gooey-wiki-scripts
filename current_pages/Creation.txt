=== '''Creation of the World of Zyathé''' ===
The world of '''Zyathé''', also known as the '''Wy’rded World''', was created through the divine will of '''AvovA, the Dreamer of the First Dream'''. A world of '''magic, conflict, and corruption''', Zyathé has endured cataclysmic events that have shaped its present form. The most significant of these was the '''Woe of Ruin''', an apocalyptic collapse of high magic that sundered civilizations and permanently altered the world.
----

== '''Description''' ==
Zyathé is a '''vast and diverse world''', containing '''multiple continents, deep underground realms, and countless planes of existence'''. The world is intrinsically linked to the '''Zyanthuus''', the fundamental magical force that binds reality together.

The '''surface world''' consists of sprawling continents, each home to distinct civilizations, while the '''Underdelve (Zyanduun)''' extends deep below, harboring its own horrors and societies.

The sky of Zyathé features multiple celestial bodies, including the '''Suleón (the sun)''', the '''large moon Luneós''', and the eerie '''Spectre Moon, Koruptéon''', which appears unpredictably.
----

== '''Notable Events''' ==

=== '''The Great Making''' ===
AvovA '''spoke The Way of All Things''', bringing forth '''the Zyanthuus''' as the foundation of existence. From it, he shaped '''the gods, the planes, and the mortal world of Zyathé'''.

=== '''The Rise of the Four Lords of Corruption''' ===
Unbeknownst to AvovA, four '''fragments of darkness''' emerged at the edge of creation. These beings—'''Anarchria, Nuul, Foendeuz, and Za'''—grew into '''the Lords of Corruption''', entities of '''chaos, void, ruin, and warping magic'''. They infiltrated the '''Zyanthuus''', tainting it with the '''Netherflow''', a source of twisted and malevolent power.

=== '''The War of the Gods and the Maker’s Sacrifice''' ===
The gods of Zyathé fought a desperate battle against '''the Four Lords''', but their power was insufficient. In an act of finality, '''AvovA merged his essence with the Zyanthuus''', cleansing the corruption and '''banishing the Four Lords to the Never-Place''', a prison beyond time. This act, however, cost AvovA his existence, leaving '''Zyathé forever altered'''.

=== '''The Woe of Ruin''' ===
Many millennia later, Zyathé suffered '''another cataclysm''', known as '''the Woe of Ruin'''. The '''collapse of High Magicks''' tore the world apart, shattering civilizations and corrupting the land. This event marked the '''end of the Ethernic civilization''', whose mastery of magic '''spiraled into catastrophe''', leaving behind '''ruins infused with unstable and dangerous magical energies'''.

== '''Biology and the Effect of Magic''' ==
The '''Zyanthuus''', despite AvovA’s sacrifice, remains '''tainted by remnants of the Netherflow''', causing unpredictable effects:

* '''Monstrous Aberrations''' – Many creatures have been '''twisted by corrupted magic''', evolving into '''dangerous new forms'''.
