=== '''Lord Kalnovich''' ===

==== '''Overview''' ====
Lord Kalnovich, also known as the ''Dread Lich, Dread Lord, The Lich Lord, The High Lord Sovereign of the Vile Desolation, The Last True Humanitarian, The Shadowlord, The Pallid Lord,'' or ''The Pale Prince'', is the ruler of the Vile Desolation, a blighted region in West Verdestia. An ancient figure of immense power, he was once a mortal high mage of the Ethernic civilization and a member of the Black Coventicle. He foresaw the Woe of Ruin and entered lichdom, using the chaos to solidify his power. Kalnovich seeks to spread undeath, believing it to be a superior existence free from mortality’s limitations.

==== '''Physical Description''' ====
Kalnovich is a towering, skeletal figure with sepulchral green eyes and a misaligned nose. His pale skin, marked by decay, can regenerate damage over time. His long gray hair and beard add to his grim visage, and he wears regal, razor-edged robes with a spiked crown. Though he bears no formal royal title, his moniker ''The Pale Prince'' has become both a mockery and a badge of pride.

==== '''Personality''' ====
Ruthlessly cunning, Kalnovich is a master strategist who leaves little to chance. While he recognizes the gods' importance, he considers their promises of the afterlife dubious and envisions himself as a better candidate for divinity—particularly as the rightful Lord of the Undead, a title currently held by Norcreus. He is patient, working through intermediaries and long-term plots to achieve his goals.

==== '''Abilities & Special Qualities''' ====
Kalnovich is an immensely powerful necromancer, capable of commanding legions of undead. He has blended necromantic magic with divine influences, possibly creating a new class of magic unique to himself. He also taps into corrupted high-cycle magic, attempting to master the debased flows of the Everflow. His presence in the Vile Desolation empowers undead, causing them to regenerate and reanimate.

==== '''Background & History''' ====
Born in the Ethernic era, Kalnovich was a high mage who abandoned the Black Coventicle before the Woe of Ruin. Surviving the catastrophe, he maneuvered from the shadows, amassing resources and power until he emerged as the sovereign of the Vile Desolation. His mastery over undeath allowed him to consolidate rule over his land and extend his influence beyond its borders.

==== '''Alliances & Relationships''' ====
Kalnovich’s Vile Desolation maintains loose alliances with the Vilandean Empire and the High Elves of Avourda’maleu. He trades with various entities, including the Isle of Albis. He has a complicated relationship with Norcreus, believing the god must either embrace undeath or be replaced—potentially by Kalnovich himself. He also has adversaries, such as Krun, the Vampire Chieftess, who wages guerrilla warfare against him. Previously Kalnovich had a close, personal friendship with Galceanthras, the leader of the Black Conventicle, but this relationship ended prior to the Woe of Ruin when Kalnovich was unable to convince his once friend to put aside his plans to cast "The Way of All Things.". Unable to prevent the calamity from occurring, Kalnovich has sworn to better the world, as a form of atonement for his failure to prevent the Woe of Ruin.

==== '''Notable Appearances & Involvement''' ====
Kalnovich plays a significant role in the geopolitical conflicts of West Verdestia, influencing wars, assassinations, and political maneuvering. He is responsible for manipulating historical events like the Ten Years War and the rise of Magdronog. His secretive cult, ''Esha’agrym'', (roughly translating to The Ghastly Shadow) spreads his influence through warlocks who pledge themselves to his service. This cult worships Kalnovich as a god, referring to him reverently as "The Pallid Lord".
