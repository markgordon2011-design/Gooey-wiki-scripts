As well, Gooey Cube creates books of lore called Cyclopaedias, which explain everything you need to know about the world of Zyathé - a cursed world which was first created by AvovA, who spoke into existence All Things.

Though the four were imprisoned by AvovA before his death, they kept scheming... eventually bringing about the Woe of Ruin, the second cataclysm to wreak havoc upon the Life World.
