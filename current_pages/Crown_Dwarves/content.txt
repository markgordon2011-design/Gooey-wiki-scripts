=== '''Crown Dwarves (Trununda Dem) in Zyathé''' ===
The '''Crown Dwarves''', or '''Trununda Dem''', are one of the two primary Dwarven peoples of Zyathé.

== '''Description''' ==
Crown Dwarves are '''short and stocky''', standing '''between four and five feet tall'''. They possess '''ruddy, earth-toned skin''', with '''deep-set eyes''' ranging from '''brown, amber, or emerald'''. Their '''hair is dense''', typically in shades of '''strawberry blonde to auburn''', with '''male Crown Dwarves renowned for their meticulously groomed beards'''.

Their clothing is often '''functional yet finely crafted''', emphasizing '''durability and traditional Dwarven aesthetics'''. Many wear '''jewelry, brooches, and metallic embellishments''', often '''inscribed with runic symbols of their clans'''.
----

== '''Personality''' ==
Crown Dwarves are characterized by their '''pragmatic and diligent nature'''. They '''value hard work, craftsmanship, and loyalty''' above all else. Unlike some of their more secretive kin, they are '''socially inclined''', forming strong bonds with their communities and allies. However, they can be '''stubborn and prideful''', particularly when it comes to matters of honor or trade.

Despite their often '''gruff demeanor''', Crown Dwarves possess a '''deep sense of responsibility and duty'''. Many still see themselves as the '''defenders of civilization''', holding the line against '''incursions from the Underdelve, Orokonoids, and monstrous threats'''.

== '''Abilities''' ==
Crown Dwarves inherit several traits that reflect their '''sturdy nature and centuries of tradition''':

* '''Stoneborn Resilience:''' Resistant to '''poisons and natural toxins''', and highly '''adaptable to underground environments'''.
* '''Master Craftsmen:''' Exceptionally skilled in '''stonecutting, smithing, and metalworking'''.
* '''Endurance:''' Naturally '''hardy and resilient''', capable of '''withstanding extreme labor and harsh conditions'''.
* '''Runic Knowledge:''' While not as magically inclined as some races, Crown Dwarves '''have a deep understanding of runes and enchanted craftsmanship'''.

----

== '''Society''' ==
Crown Dwarven society is '''deeply structured''', emphasizing '''clan-based governance'''. Leadership is often '''hereditary''', passed down within '''noble houses of engineers, merchants, and warriors'''. Their cities, known as '''clanholmes''', are '''fortified underground strongholds''', many of which date back to before the '''Woe of Ruin'''.

Dwarven '''trade and banking''' influence many economies across Zyathé, and '''Dwarven coinage is considered a universal standard'''. Despite their focus on industry and commerce, they maintain a '''strong military presence''', protecting their '''vast underground highways''' and '''fortresses from threats emerging from the Underdelve'''.

Notable Crown Dwarven settlements include:

* '''Trundadelve''' – A wealthy '''Dwarven metropolis''' beneath the Wyrmrest Mountains.
* '''Sundervulden''' – A major '''trading hub''' in the Republic of Zyranthea.
* '''Geldenvold''' – A semi-independent '''Dwarven city within Andvalla'''.

== '''Biology''' ==
Crown Dwarves have '''long lifespans''', often reaching '''300-400 years'''. They are '''omnivorous''', but their '''diet heavily consists of underground-grown fungi, hearty grains, and meats''' such as '''mountain goat and deep-dwelling fish'''. They are known for their '''love of strong ales and fermented beverages''', many of which are '''prized exports'''.

Dwarven reproduction is '''slower compared to other races''', with '''low birth rates but strong family bonds'''. This has led to a '''protective and close-knit''' cultural outlook.
----

== '''History''' ==
Crown Dwarves were the '''first of their kind''', created by the gods '''Caovern, Evrodonn, Buffahn, and others''' to be the '''stewards of the mountains and deep places'''. Their '''prudence spared them from the full devastation of the Woe of Ruin''', as their underground cities '''sheltered them from the worst magical cataclysms'''.

Key historical moments:

* '''Creation and the Divine Favor''' – Crown Dwarves were '''crafted as master artisans''', embodying the endurance and craftsmanship of their creators.

* '''Modern Influence''' – Today, Crown Dwarves remain '''one of the most powerful and respected peoples of Zyathé''', playing a '''vital role in commerce, engineering, and warfare'''.
