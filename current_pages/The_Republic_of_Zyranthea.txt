The Republic of Zyranthea is a vast constitutional republic in central '''West Verdestia''', bordered by the '''Wyrmrest Mountains''' to the east, the '''Mystranic Ocean''' to the west, '''Andvalla''' to the south, and the '''Vile Desolation''' to the north. Once a collection of city-states, it was unified for mutual defense and trade. The Republic spans approximately '''80,000 square miles''', with half of the land still untamed wilderness. The climate varies from temperate coastal regions to rugged highlands.
